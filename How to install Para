Drag the Parallel folder into your MPW folder, at the same level
as your shell.
If you'd like the Parallel folder to be somewhere else, you'll need to
change the path specifications in the Para.Make and ParaGS.Make
files.
I've included a script file that sets up the Para menu I used while 
writing this.  Open the Scripts folder and drag the ParaMenu file from
there to your {MPW}Scripts: folder.
Then run the ParaMenu script to get the Para menu.
I included this for newcomers to MPW to get an idea of the power of
the MPW environment, and how you can make MPW work for you in 
any project you're working on.
If you'd like to build 'em manually, just hilite the following two lines,
and press enter

Buildprogram Para
Buildprogram ParaGS
